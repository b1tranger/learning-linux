- suggestions?<br>
"1. never play with real data, unless you know what you're doing. (real data = data you care about, will regret if they're lost)
<br>2. always have backup
<br>and you're good to go"
- distro?<br>"you can also try fedora, as the godfather suggests fedora"
<br>can I customize ubuntu like arch?
<br>"yes,could be quite complicated tho. but arch or customizing like arch is very hardcore stuff for you."
<br>I see. for now I will try getting used to git and stuff
