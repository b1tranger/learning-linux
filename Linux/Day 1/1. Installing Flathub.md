### # note:
- use `CTRL+SHIFT+V` to paste into the terminal, otherwise the pasted content is funny
- I will do the subsequent app  installations from Flathub. Like [Discord](https://discord.com/)

### # commands:
- To install Flatpak on Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish) or later, 
  open the Terminal app and run:
  ```
  sudo apt install flatpak
  ```
  <pre>The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:
  libllvm19
  Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove it.</pre>

- The GNOME Software plugin makes it possible to install apps without needing the command line. 
  To install, run:
  ```
  sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
  ```
  <pre>Note that the directories </pre>

    `&apos;/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share&apos;`<br>
    `&apos;/home/saraf/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share&apos;`

  <pre>are not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so
  applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the
  session is restarted.
  </pre>
- Add the Flathub repository  Flathub is the best place to get Flatpak apps. To enable it, run:
  ```
  flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
  ```
- To complete setup, restart your system.

  running

  ```
