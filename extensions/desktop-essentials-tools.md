- Google Drive for Desktop | While Google doesn't offer an
official native client for Linux, you can easily integrate Google Drive via built-in desktop environment features (like GNOME Online Accounts for Ubuntu/Mint) for seamless file manager access, or use powerful third-party tools like Rclone (command-line) or Insync (GUI) for advanced syncing and local folder mirroring. Most modern Linux systems provide simple ways to mount Drive as a network location without installing extra apps, or offer robust alternatives for true local sync
- Git Client (GUI) | does git kraken work like github desktop?<br>Yes, both
GitKraken and GitHub Desktop function as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Git, allowing users to perform standard version control operations (like committing, pushing, and pulling) without the command line. However, GitKraken is a more feature-rich and advanced tool designed for teams, while GitHub Desktop is a simpler, more basic tool aimed primarily at beginners or simple repository management tasks.
